Integrates BTBuckets behavioral targeting into your WordPress installation.

== Description ==

This plugin helps enable behavioral targeting on your WordPress blog by easily
integrating [BTBuckets](http://btbuckets.com/site/signup#utm_source=developer&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wordpress_thaya)
into your WordPress installation. This integration allows you to easily show
or hide specific widgets to any type of visitors. Just think of WP Greet Box or
Who Sees Ads plugin turbocharged.

= Some usage examples include: =
* Show ads widget to only search engine visitors.
* Show subscribe widget to only returning visitors.
* Show an "about me" widget to only new visitors.
... and the list goes on and on (let creativity be your guide!).

= Using A Cache Plugin? =

No problem! This plugin is fully compatible with any other cache plugins as it
leverages BTBucket's awesome JavaScript API to get things done so your widgets
will still show up differently per visitor type.

== Installation ==

1. Create a free [BTBuckets](http://btbuckets.com/site/signup#utm_source=developer&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wordpress_thaya) account.
2. Upload the plugin to your plugins folder: 'wp-content/plugins/'
3. Activate the 'WP BTBuckets' plugin from the plugins admin panel.
4. Go to Settings -> WP BTBuckets and enter your BTBuckets API Key.
